## Updating to the most recent version of Solcore and RayFlare

We need to make sure everyone is running the most recent version of Solcore and RayFlare. To do this, open VSCode, make
sure you have a command line with the right Python interpreter open (we will demonstrate this, don't worry) and run:

```
python3.11 -m pip install --upgrade solcore rayflare
```

## Link to examples:

You can find the examples we will be going through [here](https://github.com/qpv-research-group/solcore-education/tree/solcore-workshop).

Download the files by clicking "Code" (green box, top right) and then "Download ZIP". Then unzip this folder and open
it in VSCode.

If you have trouble with the installation or running the files locally, you can try running them in the cloud 
[here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/qpv-research-group/solcore-education/solcore-workshop?labpath=solcore-workshop-2%2Fnotebooks).

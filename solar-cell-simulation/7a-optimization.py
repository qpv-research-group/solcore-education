# In a few of the previous examples, we have used anti-reflection coatings. In example 5a, we introduced a nanophotonic
# grating for light trapping. But how do you find out the right thickness for the anti-reflection coating layer(s),
# or the right dimensions for a light-trapping grating? This is where optimization comes in. Here, we will look at a very
# simple 'brute-force' optimization for a single or double-layer ARC in example 7a, and a more complicated framework for
# running optimizations using Solcore/RayFlare and a differential evolution algorithm.

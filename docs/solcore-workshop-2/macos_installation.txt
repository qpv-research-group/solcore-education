Note: some of the commands listed here differ slightly from those seen in the video. 
Although they should do exactly the same thing, please use the ones listed here.

1. Install Python 3.11 from python.org (note the final installation location)

2. Install Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and open it

3. Create a new folder anywhere you want

4. From within VSCode, create a file called hello_world.py (or any other name you like,
   as long as it ends in .py), and type in that empty file:
	
print("Hello world!")

   Press Command + Shift + P to open the Command Palette in VSCode, and type
   "Python Interpreter", to make sure VSCode uses the version of Python you just
   installed.

   Then run the file (play button). VSCode will prompt you to install the 
   Python extension; agree to this.

5. Running the file opens a Terminal window within VSCode. Into this window,
   type/copy and paste:

python3.11 -m pip install solcore rayflare seaborn

6. Python, Solcore and Rayflare are installed! To check everything is working, 
   you can add the following code to your hello_world.py file and run it again:

from solcore import solar_cell_solver
from rayflare.transfer_matrix_method import tmm_structure

print("Success!")

   If this prints the "Success!" to your terminal, things are installed. Do
   not worry about any warnings which appear.

7. We will also be using Jupyter notebooks during the workshop (these are files
   which let you combine Python code blocks, normal text, images etc.). First, 
   type into the terminal:

python3.11 -m pip install jupyter

8. To make sure VSCode installs the required extensions, make a new file called 
   hello_world.ipynb, and copy the contents of hello_world.py into this file. Click
   "Select Kernel" in the top right hand corner of the script, then choose the Python3.11
   that was installed earlier. VSCode should again prompt you to install several extensions.

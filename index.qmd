title: "solcore-education"

This is the website for the solcore-education GitHub, where we host readable versions of Solcore and RayFlare examples,
which are linked on the left. Note that this is not an introductory Python course, or a course about the fundamentals of
solar cells.

The examples on this website are hosted in Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) format for readability. To run the examples yourself,
you can find standard .py versions on the GitHub [here](https://github.com/qpv-research-group/solcore-education/tree/main/solar-cell-simulation).
We recommend using these rather than the Notebook versions.

**Package requirements**

To use these examples, you will need to install [Solcore](http://docs.solcore.solar/en/master/Installation/installation.html)
and [RayFlare](https://rayflare.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation/installation.html) (the links take you to installation
instructions for each package). In the simplest case, you can install them with:

```
pip install solcore rayflare
```

But this will not install all functionality, as detailed in the documentation for both packages.

The only other dependency, which is used for plotting, is `seaborn`, which you can install simply with:

```
pip install seaborn
```
